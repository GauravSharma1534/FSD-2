# Title #

Design and Development of a Single Page Application using React and Vite with Client-Side Routing

 # Aim #

To implement routing and component-based architecture in a Single Page Application using React and Vite.

# Objective # 

To design and develop a basic Single Page Application using a modern frontend framework and understand client-side rendering.

# Description #

This experiment demonstrates the creation of a Single Page Application (SPA) using React and Vite. Client-side routing is implemented using the **react-router-dom** library, which allows navigation between different pages without reloading the browser.
The application consists of multiple components such as Home, About, Contact, and SPA. Navigation is handled on the client side, providing a smooth and fast user experience. The project follows a component-based architecture and is deployed on Netlify for public access.
The following components from react-router-dom are used:

BrowserRouter
* Routes
* Route
* Link

# Technologies Used #

* React.js
* Vite
* JavaScript (ES6)
* HTML5
* CSS3
* GitHub (Version Control)
* Netlify (Deployment)

# Libraries Used #
* **react** – Core library for building user interfaces
* **react-dom** – Renders React components in the browser
* **react-router-dom** – Used for client-side routing
   * BrowserRouter
   * Routes
   * Route
   * Link

# Software and Hardware Requirements #
## Software Requirements ##
* Node.js
* npm
* React
* Vite
* VS Code
* Web Browser (Chrome / Edge)

# Description of Files # 
* **assets/** – Stores static resources
* **components/** – Contains all page components
* **Home.jsx** – Home page component
* **About.jsx** – About page component
* **Contact.jsx** – Contact page component
* **Spa.jsx** – SPA content component
* **App.jsx** – Defines routing logic
* **main.jsx** – Application entry point

# Algorithm / Procedure #
* Install Node.js and npm on the system.
* Create a new React project using Vite.
* Install react-router-dom using npm.
* Create separate components for Home, About, Contact, and SPA pages.
* Configure routing using BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route.
* Add navigation links using the **Link** component.
* Apply CSS styling for layout and responsiveness.
* Run the application using the Vite development server.
* Build the project for production.
* Deploy the project on **Netlify**.

Features
* Single Page Application architecture
* Component-based UI design
* Fast rendering using Vite
* Smooth navigation without page reload
 * Responsive layout

# Output #
The application successfully renders different pages without reloading the browser. Navigation between components is smooth and fast, demonstrating the correct working of a Single Page Application.

# Deployment #
The project is deployed on Netlify.

# Learning Outcomes #
* After completing this experiment, I gained a clear understanding of:
* Single Page Application concepts
* React component-based architecture
* Client-side routing using React Router
* Project setup using Vite
* Standard React folder structure
* Deployment on Netlify
* Using GitHub for version control

# Conclusion #
This experiment provided hands-on experience with modern frontend development using React. It highlighted how Single Page Applications improve performance and user experience by using client-side routing and avoiding unnecessary page reloads.

modern frontend development using React. It highlighted the advantages of Single Page Applications over traditional websites in terms of performance, responsiveness, and user experience.
