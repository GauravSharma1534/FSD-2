Design and Development of a Single Page Application using React and Vite with Client-Side Routing

 # Aim #

To implement routing and component-based architecture in a Single Page Application using React and Vite.

# Objective # 

To design and develop a basic Single Page Application using a modern frontend framework and understand client-side rendering.

# Description #

This experiment demonstrates the creation of a Single Page Application (SPA) using React and Vite. Client-side routing is implemented using the react-router-dom library, which allows navigation between different pages without reloading the browser.
The application consists of multiple components such as Home, About, Contact, and SPA. Navigation is handled on the client side, providing a smooth and fast user experience. The project follows a component-based architecture and is deployed on Netlify for public access.
The following components from react-router-dom are used:

BrowserRouter
* Routes
* Route
* Link

# Technologies Used #

* React.js
* Vite
* JavaScript (ES6)
* HTML5
* CSS3

GitHub (Version Control)

Netlify (Deployment)

Libraries Used

react – Core library for building user interfaces

react-dom – Renders React components in the browser

react-router-dom – Used for client-side routing

Description of Files

assets/ – Stores static resources

components/ – Contains all page components

Home.jsx – Home page component

About.jsx – About page component

Contact.jsx – Contact page component

Spa.jsx – SPA content component

App.jsx – Defines routing logic

main.jsx – Application entry point

Algorithm / Procedure

Install Node.js and npm on the system.

Create a new React project using Vite.

Install react-router-dom using npm.

Create separate components for Home, About, Contact, and SPA pages.

Configure routing using BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route.

Add navigation links using the Link component.

Apply CSS styling for layout and responsiveness.

Run the application using the Vite development server.

Build the project for production.

Deploy the project on Netlify.

Features

Single Page Application architecture

Component-based UI design

Fast rendering using Vite

Smooth navigation without page reload

Responsive layout

Output

The application successfully renders different pages without reloading the browser. Navigation between components is smooth and fast, demonstrating the correct working of a Single Page Application.

Deployment

The project is deployed on Netlify.

Learning Outcomes

After completing this experiment, I gained a clear understanding of:

Single Page Application concepts

React component-based architecture

Client-side routing using React Router

Project setup using Vite

Standard React folder structure

Deployment on Netlify

Using GitHub for version control

Conclusion

If you want, I can also:

Shorten this for exam writing

Adjust it to your college format

Add screenshots and output images

Match it exactly with your ZIP project code

Just tell me 👍

write ## and ** and 8

Got it. You want the same experiment, properly formatted with ## headings, bold text, and Experiment-8 clearly mentioned.

Below is final, submission-ready content. You can paste it directly into your record file or README.md.
